                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of an undefined datatype is to denote an absence of a meaningful value. Many operations in JavaScript produce a meaningless result and to represent that, they return an undefined value, simply, because they have to return something!
                        A variable in JavaScript that is without any value has a value of undefined. The datatype of a variable that holds an undefined value is also 'undefined'.</p>
